# Beginner's Mindset

Taking notes on books I read, talks I watch, articles I study, and papers I love â€“ recalling them right afterward by creating short summaries. This helps a lot in my learning process. Here you'll find some of those little pieces.

This is my personal learning space. I keep it for my enjoyment, if you are thinking about adding your summaries it may be a better idea to start your own.

If you have any suggestions for improvement please feel free to open a pull request.

Thanks!
